SpokePOV Firmware

This is the source code for the firmware for the Adafruit SpokePOV kit:

The SpokePOV uses an Atmel ATtiny2313.

This repo is based off of the Adafruit 1.01 code release:

I've updated the firmware to compile with recent avr-libc; in particular, I've
updated the signal handlers to use the new ISR macro convention.

There are two branches:  

master is the Adafruit source, updated to use new ISR conventions.
 
chase is modified to run a "chasing" light pattern along the line of the spoke
whenever the wheel stops turning. The lights cycle for about 90 seconds. It
also adjusts the code to actually turn the lights completely off after some
inactivity.
